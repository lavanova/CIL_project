# Classical-neural Recommendation System

This is the codebase for the team `Project Passline` on Project: Collaborative Filtering in the course Computational Intelligence Lab of ETH Zurich in Spring 2019. 

Our classical-neural approach blends neural networks based methods and classical non-neural collaborative filtering methods. Our solution achieves 0.97102 RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) on private test set and stands at the second place.
